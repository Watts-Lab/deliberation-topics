We will eventually have an app which we serve to participants to help them localize their topics in a space. It will create pairwise comparisons between pairs of items, and ask participants to indicate which item is further along with dimension.

It will live here for now, and may eventually get broken out as shared infrastructure if we decide to use it in multiple projects.
