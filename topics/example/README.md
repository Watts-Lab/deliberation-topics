# Example Topic

This topic is an example topic meant for use in developing and testing the deliberation experiment infrastructure. 
The question is facetious - we were always going to use markdown.

This readme file contains descriptions about where the topic originated and how it has been used in deliberative exercises in the past.
It also includes descriptions of why it was included in this collection, and what it is intended to test.

### Sources
This topic was spontaneously extemporized at need, and has (to my knowledge) not previously been used in deliberative exercises.
