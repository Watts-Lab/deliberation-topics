# Question-Structured Discussion

### Now we're in the question-structured phase of the discussion

In this stage you discuss specific topics, guided by a series of multiple-choice questions.  The first question will appear in 30 seconds.

When you get a question, first answer it (your answers are private), and then discuss your views about it as a group.

After answering the question, everyone their views on the topic of the question until you receive the next question.
