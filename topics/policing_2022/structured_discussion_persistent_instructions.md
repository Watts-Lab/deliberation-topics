# Question-Structured Discussion

### Now we're in the question-structured phase of the discussion

In this stage you discuss specific topics, guided by a series of multiple-choice questions.  The questions are meant to structure the discussion: when you get a question, first answer it privately, and then discuss your views about it as a group.

When you see a new question, please stop talking and select your answer to the question (your answers are private).  After answering the question, the group should discuss their views on the topic of the question, until you receive the next question.
