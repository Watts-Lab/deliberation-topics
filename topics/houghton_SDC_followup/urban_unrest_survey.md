### What is the best way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting?

### Some say it is more important to use all available force to maintain law and order, no matter what results.

### Others say it is more important to correct the problems of racism and police violence that give rise to the disturbances.

### And, of course, other people have opinions in between.

- Where would you place yourself on this scale?
