## Prompt
What is the best way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting?
Some say it is more important to use all available force to maintain law and order, no matter what results.
Others say it is more important to correct the problems of racism and police violence that give rise to the disturbances. And, of
course, other people have opinions in between.
- Where would you place yourself on this scale, or havenâ€™t you thought much about this?
