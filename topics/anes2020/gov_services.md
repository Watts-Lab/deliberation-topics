# Government providing services

## Prompt
Some people think the government should provide fewer services
even in areas such as health and education in order to reduce
spending. Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point
1.
Other people feel it is important for the government to provide many
more services even if it means an increase in spending. Suppose
these people are at the other end, at point 7.

between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
