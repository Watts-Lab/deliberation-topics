# Government Guarantees Job

### Type
Economic

## Prompt
Some people feel the government in Washington should see to it that
every person has a job and a good standard of living. Suppose these
people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.
Others think the government should just let each person get ahead
on their own. Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Where would you place yourself on this scale, or havenâ€™t you thought much about this?
