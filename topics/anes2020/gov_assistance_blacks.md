# Government Assistance to Black People

### Type
Economic

## Prompt
Some people feel that the government in Washington should make
every effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks.
Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at point 1.
Others feel that the government should not make any special effort to
help blacks because they should help themselves. Suppose these
people are at the other end, at point 7.
And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in
between, at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Where would you place yourself on this scale, or havenâ€™t you
thought much about this?
