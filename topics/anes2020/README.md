### Background Information

The ANES and these topics in particular were selected as a source for potential deliberation topics based on partisanship research by [Baldassarri and Gelman (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056259/pdf/nihms-456998.pdf). Their selected topics of research were sourced from longitudinal data, spanning many decades of ANES surveys. Many questions in the longitudinal data either no longer exist or have been altered in the most recent 2020 data. As such, this folder contains a mixed bag of questions that were chosen either because of their inclusion in the Baldassarri and Gelman research, similarity to questions in the Baldassarri and Gelman research, or importance in our current political climate. 

Each issue is assigned a "type," similar to how Baldassarri and Gelman categorized their issues. Of course, because of the alteration of old questions and inclusion of new ones, these variables have not been categorized into exactly the same format. Additionally, among these data are questions that fit into a new category of "nonpartisan" issues, specifically chosen because of their uncontroversiality.

As can be seen in this repositority's map, the data were measured and plotted along two dimensions: variance and partisanship. The goal of this mapping is to determine how different sorts of interventions will work when dicussing different types of issue (e.g., informing participants will lower affective polarization *only* when dealing with issues of low partisanship). 

### Sources
These issues and their associated background information were sourced from the 2020 ANES questionaire:
