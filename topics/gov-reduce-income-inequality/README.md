# Government Reducing Income Inequality

This question probes deliberators to consider whether or not (and how much) our government should work to reduce income inequality.
Economic issues like these touch at the root of almost everyone's lives (as opposed to something like gun control which may not be a problem in everyone's day to day).
It will be interesting to see how the personal aspect of a face-to-face deliberation will depolarize our group through sharing perspectives on income ineuqality and that role that government should play in mediating income equality. 

### Background Information

This question was chosen because of its strong ties to political party affiliation (0.5 correlation) and its particularly high normalized variance (0.69).
The results from our deliberation on this topic can tell us a fair bit about the plasuability of our treatments given a controversial and polarizing topic.
The most polarizing topic from our data was how to deal with urban unrest--but we anticipate that this topic was only so high at the time because this survey was administered at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
This topic is a safer bet for a controversial topic that likely has not changed unpredictably in the last two years.
